This project used the Discrete Curvelet Transform to extract statistical features from handwritten characters in order to establish the identity of the writer. A profile was constructed for each user, and samples of their handwriting were analyzed. New writing samples could then be analyzed and have their statistical features compared to the character of each user profile.
